# Heart-Failure-Predictors

An analysis of 12 clinical features for 299 patients with heart failure. 

### Purpose

To find clinical features that were more common in patients who died in order to predict mortality by heart failure.

### Analyses Performed 

**PivotTables** were used to compare quantitative features for patients who died/survived. 

**Normal distribution** calculations were performed and associated **bell curve line graphs** for ages.

### Findings

Patients who **died** from heart failure had, on average: 
* **Higher creatine phosphokinase** levels (21.5%)
* A **lower ejection fraction** (18.4%)
* **Higher serum creatinine** levels (43.1%) 
Compared to patients who survived.

Focusing on these features may assist in early detection and management in patients with cardiovascular disease.
